      The war began when two planets simultaneously discovered how to use hyperspeed for travel (1). 
       While scientifically groundbreaking, the 
       discovery was unfortunately used as a weapon. Other societies have quickly caught up to (hyper)speed. After 18 years of battles 
       and pacifist attempts at brokering a peace treaty, the war finally ended, leading to the creation of the UMW.
